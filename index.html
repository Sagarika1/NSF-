<center><h1>The NSF Computer programming class</h1></center>
<h3>Hello, my name is Sagarika Srinivasan and I am in 7th grade. Welcome to my website! I've done several NSF classes but none have been like this programming class. From our customized apps to translating languages, my teacher, Prianka, helped us a whole lot throughout the course. She took time out of her day to schedule office hours throughout the week. In those sessions you could review something you didn't understand in class or express any confusion on the homework. The homework was split into two parts most of the time. A slightly easier assignment and a slighty harder assignment is given. You choose which one you would like to do or, if you are up to it, you can do both. That was a nice attribute to the course so that for certain topics, you aren't struggling but you aren't insanely bored. I've enjoyed this class so much and I'm sure that if you join you will too!  </h3>
